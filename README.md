# Twu.Bucketlist

First android app -  7.0 Nougat

The milestone upload of our app pulls up a [Bucket] List of items 
upon boot, pre-populated along with the floating button [Requirement 1 and 2.]
You have the ability to expand each item and view its full description [Req. 3.]
The app has custom images as icons for aesthetics :) and from 3 device tests
did not crash or lag. [Req. 4]
